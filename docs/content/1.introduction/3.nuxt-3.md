# Usage with Nuxt 3

::alert{type="warning"}
If you upgrading from v2 to v3, please remove the `dist/style.css` import from your `app.vue` file. This css is now imported automatically by the plugin.
::

## Register the component globally

1. Create a folder called **`plugins`** at the root of your project.

2. Create a file named **`Vue3Lottie.client.ts`** inside the `plugins` directory.

3. Add the following code to the file:

   ```js
   import { Vue3Lottie } from 'vue3-lottie'

   export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
     nuxtApp.vueApp.component('Vue3Lottie', Vue3Lottie)
   })
   ```

   ::alert{type="success"}
   ✨ Well done!
   This should register a global component that you can call anywhere in your app under the `<Vue3Lottie>` tag. You can also change the name of the component by changing the `name` property in the plugin file.
   ::

## Register the component locally

The component can also simply be imported locally.

   ```ts
<script setup lang="ts">
   import { Vue3Lottie } from 'vue3-lottie'
</script>
   ```

## Use the component

Now you can use the component. Here is an example of how to use it in a page.

::alert{type="warning"}
Using the `<client-only>` tag is recommended to prevent any hydration errors.
::

```html
<template>
  ...

  <client-only>
    <Vue3Lottie
      animationLink="https://assets10.lottiefiles.com/packages/lf20_soCRuE.json"
      :height="200"
      :width="200"
    />
  </client-only>

  ...
</template>
```
